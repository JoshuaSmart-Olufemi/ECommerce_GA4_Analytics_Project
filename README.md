# E-Commerce-GA4-Analytics-Project

This repository contains a comprehensive data modeling and analytics project built around Google Analytics 4 (GA4) e-commerce event data. The project leverages dbt to transform raw, event-level GA4 data into a structured, queryable format using an Activity Schema approach, enabling deep insights into user behavior and conversion funnels.

# Key Features
## Traffic Source & Campaign Performance Analysis:
Model and analyze user sessions by capturing key dimensions such as utm_source, utm_medium, and utm_campaign. Evaluate the effectiveness of marketing channels and campaigns by linking traffic data to conversion events.

## Scroll Depth & Content Performance Analysis:
Extract and aggregate scroll events and page engagement metrics to understand how users interact with content. Identify high and low performing pages, and pinpoint opportunities for content optimization.

## User Behavior Flow:
Trace the full user journey from session start and page views to specific conversion events. Analyze common pathways and drop-off points using window functions and sequential event tracking.

## Funnel Analysis:
Build robust models to calculate critical metrics like checkout completion rate, drop-off rates at various funnel stages, cart abandonment rate, and conversion rates across multiple steps (e.g., from viewing a product to adding shipping info, and finally completing payment).

Activity Schema Data Modeling:
Utilize an Activity Schema approach where every event is treated as an immutable fact record. This design ensures historical data integrity and provides a scalable, time-series analysis framework for user interactions.

# Whatâ€™s Included
## dbt Models:

Staging Models: Clean and normalize raw GA4 event data.

Intermediate Models: Assign funnel steps and aggregate metrics.

Final Fact Tables: Provide session-level insights for funnel performance, user behavior, and campaign analysis.
SQL Examples:
Code snippets for PostgreSQL and ClickHouse are provided to demonstrate conversion rate calculations, drop-off analysis, and other key performance indicators.

## Documentation:
Detailed documentation explains the data transformations, business logic behind metric definitions, and instructions for deploying the project.

## Testing & Validation:
Automated tests ensure data quality and consistency throughout the transformation pipeline.

# Purpose
This project is designed to empower e-commerce businesses with actionable insights drawn from GA4 data. By understanding user behavior and identifying bottlenecks in the conversion process, companies can optimize their marketing strategies, improve the checkout process, and ultimately drive higher conversions and revenue.
